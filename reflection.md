What are your initial impressions of how `Unit Testing` affects your programming?
What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
for this assignment it is not very hard to code, since there's some reminders before the computer and resaleshop's methods. However, I believe in the future's coding process, find out the exception and knowing what to test will be the most important thing.
The testPrintInventory was refine by AI, and I learned a new method "ByteArrayOutputStream", which is used to store but not print out the outcome.
